## TIFs in the Primary Community Areas

There have been 146 projects completed with the assistance of TIF funding in the primary community areas targeted by the ISW Initiative. With approximately $220MM of TIF funding currently slotted to contribute towards the creation of development projects in these primary community areas, an additional 86 projects have the potential to be created based on TIF Funding Ratios, Aggregate Development Costs for TIF projects, and the number of TIF projects developed in the past. See the charts below for how the past and potential of TIF financing of projects in these community areas breaksdown.

The second bar chart shows that projects in the priority community areas have historically recieved less TIF funding per project than projects outside of these areas.

## Target Areas

The map below is color scaled by ISW Priority Community Area. There are 15 primary community areas, 3 of which are formed by 2 or more Chicago neighborhoods. The Englewood primary community area is made up of the Englewood and West Englwood neighborhoods. The Bronze primary community area is made up for the Grand Boulevard, Oakland, and Kenwood neighborhoods. And, the Greater Roseland primary community area is made up the far south-side neighborhoods of Roseland, Pullman, and West Pullman.

The map below shows how TIF funded projects emanate from the Chicago Loop outward, with a considerable number of projects being located in the Loop and Near West Side.
