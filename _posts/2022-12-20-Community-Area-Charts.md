## Demographic and Economic Data by Chicago Community Area

Below, we show core dempgraphic data for the City of Chicago by neighborhood using the Altair package. The map is color scaled by total population and indicates that the North- and West-sides of the city are the most populated areas.

The dempgraphic data was sourced from the 2021 ACS 5-year estimate tables DP05 and DP03. The geometric data was sourced from the City of Chicago's open data portal.
