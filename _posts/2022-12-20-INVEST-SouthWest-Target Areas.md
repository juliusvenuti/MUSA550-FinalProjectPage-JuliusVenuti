# Brief Overview

In Fall 2019, Mayor Lori Lightfoot proposed the INVEST South/West Initiative (ISW). The plan targets approximately $2.2 Billion investment from a combination of public and private sources in 10 Chicago community areas/neighborhoods. By focusing on the revitalization of 12 commercial corridors, the INVEST South/West Initiative hopes to improve the local economies, state of housing, and quality of public realm in each of these areas. Approximately $220MM of funding for the ISW is projected to be generated via Tax-Increment Financing (TIF) Districts. The charts below simplifies all TIF funded projects in the city of Chicago nased on their location in priority community areas, as defined by the ISW. 

The data in this blog post was sourced entirely from the City of Chicago's open data portal.

The first chart shows that, on average, the approved amount of TIF funding per project is higher historically in non-priority community areas.

The second bar chart shows that projects in the priority community areas have historically recieved less TIF funding per project than projects outside of these areas.

## Working Age Population & Unemployment Rates

The maps below are color scaled by working age population (ages 20-44) and unemployment rates.

These maps indicate that the North-side of the city has the greatest perecentage of prime age workforce population, and that the South- and West-sides have the highest unemployment rates city-wide.

## Racial/Ethnic Distribution of Chicago's Total Population

The maps below are color scaled by the white, black, latino/a/x, and asian populations of Chicago. These maps distinctly represent the distribution of population by race in Chicago.

<div id="altair-chart-5"></div>
<div id="altair-chart-6"></div>

All of these maps in combination reflect the INVEST South/West Initiative's primary focus on racial and economic equity through targeted neighborhood investment.
